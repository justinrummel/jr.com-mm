In addition to revenue generating projects, provided project management for Stony River's sister companies and parent company intra-corporate IT Support services of a mixed environment of Windows, Mac, Linux by designing and implementing a new virtual infrastructure (VMWare ESXi and Microsoft HyperV).

**TKC Technology Solutions, LLC / Qivliq Commercial Group, LLC** - *Sr. Project Manager / Field Engineer (Oct 2005 - Oct 2012)* - My time at TKC Technology Solutions began with being the Project Manager for a multi-million dollar DOD OCONUS sub-sea cabling project.

Lessons learned in managing physical designed, inter-networking, and back-end offices were extremely beneficial to my career in large scale projects.
