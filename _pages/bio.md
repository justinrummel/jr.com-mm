Graduating from Ball State University with a BA in Music Engineering and a Masters in Information Communication Sciences, Justin has been traveling across the US from Maine to Alaska integrating Apple devices to business, education, and government entities for the past decade. Getting exposure to many different user environments provided great sense of lessons learned which were giving back to the MacAdmin community by presenting at several conferences: MacWorld/MacIT, MacTech, MacDMV and JAMF Software’s National User Conferences. When not presenting, he spends his time with his family, playing (horribly) piano or guitar, and racing triathlons.
