## 2020 Update

Once again I've joined the Fxck Cancer team, but now we are the [Fxck Cancer Endurance Club][fcec-ig] vs. just specifically catering to triathlons.  This is great as I like to be more balanced in my endurance adventures between ultra running, mountain bike, and orienteering.  With a new season comes a new fundraising campaign which is available at: [fxckcancer.crowdchange.co/11645/page/177661][donate-2020]

Again, **HUGE** thanks to those who donated last year.  I greatly appreciate your help.

Thank you [@fxckcancertriteam][fxck-ig] for accepting me as an Ambassador for the 2019 Fxck Cancer Triathlon Team!  It is very exciting to be representing the team for the second year in a row, and to help contribute to a great cause. As part of joining the 2019 FXCK Triathlon Team, I have also created a new donation page for 2019 at: [fxckcancer.crowdchange.co/5910/page/78337][donate].

## 2018 Original Post

In early March 2018, I discovered a triathlon team who had a mission other than friendship and fitness.  Don't get me wrong, those were the two main reasons I've been doing triathlons for the past five years and I love my [Speed Sherpa][SS] family, but after my recent surgery I've become more aware that my surgery experience was easy... I was lucky... and not everyone has those cards dealt to them while living their life.  That is why I have now joined the [Fxck Cancer Triathlon Team][fxck-team].

When you join the FCTT team, you have also made a commitment to raise money that will be donated to the main "F C Cancer Foundation" 501c3 Non Profit Organization by the end of 2018.  Not really sure how to raise money (I'm *not* a sales person), I'll see what I can do utilizing my website and social media outlets to see if anyone becomes inspired.

<figure class="align-right"><img src="{{ '/assets/images/2018/03/30/scar-256.jpg' | relative_url }}" alt="Justin Rummel profile pic" /></figure>How do you donate?  Glad you asked! Visit [my donation page][donate], and click on the big white "DONATE" button.  Once the page loads I find it easier to first scroll down to the "SIGN UP" section and create an account by entering your: name, email, password.[^1]  Once you click on "SIGN UP" and successfully have an account, then scroll back to the top and enter the standard info when making charity donations (name, address, credit card).  There are predefined monetary options, or choose "Other" on the far right hand side to set your own amount.  Anything that you can contribute would be greatly appreciated in hitting my goal.[^2]

So who is Fxck Cancer? In their words: 

> Fxck Cancer's Mission: "To fight cancer by raising awareness and to educate about early cancer detection, ultimately putting an end to late stage cancer diagnosis. Through our Dyin 2 Live Dreams program, we look to enrich the lives of those fighting cancer by offering them an experience that will bring hope, joy, inspiration, and courage into their lives. In doing this, the program hopes it can help give the cancer fighter a chance to forget, even if it’s only for a day, what they are battling. We hope it can be used as a source of inspiration to those needing a brighter day in their darkest hour." (www.fxckcancer.org)

Is this Tax Deductible?

> Yes! F C Cancer Foundation is a 501c3 nonprofit organization (Tax ID# 26-2359885)

Will donors receive donation receipts?

> Yes. When donations are made, the donor will receive a confirmation email. A separate email will be sent by a F C Cancer Foundation director to acknowledge the gift and provide tax-deductibility information, which can be used for tax purposes. When logged in, the donor may click "Profile" and "My Receipts" to view a history of contributions

Other questions are most likely answered on their [FAQ page][fxck-faq].

I'm still being coached by Speed Sherpa coach Josh, and will still race for Speed Sherpa for my A races (Xterra, AG Nationals, Ironman NC)... but in-between those events I'll be trying to promote Fxck Cancer Triathlon Team in hopes to make a small contribution to a great cause.
