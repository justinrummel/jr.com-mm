I'll be speaking at MacTech Conference 2011 which runs November 2-4 in Los Angeles with Randy Saeks!

### Discussion Topic
This discussion will review the major changes between Snow Leopard and Lion, and what it takes to configure these services. There are many changes in Lionâ€“some subtle, and some no so subtle. In either case, though, an admin needs to be aware of the changes and how it impacts them. There are changes in Directory Services, Kerberos, Database Services, Server Control, Machine Management and more. Lion is growing to be a major change vs. little differences that was experienced from Leopard to Snow Leopard. It will be easier to grasp seeing what was once performed is now accomplished by "this new process".
