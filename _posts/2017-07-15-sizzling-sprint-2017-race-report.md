I was hoping to have an improvement since May where the [Salute Sprint][salute] was held and is the same course, plus it is nice to think that over the past couple of months I would improve in at least one of the events (at least just a little).  Being the last race of the Rev3 Series, there was double pressure for me to get on the podium to protect my overall standing and try to win my Age Group division.

I was able to ride the bike loop once on Saturday for my pre-race day workout and had no concerns navigating that section of the race.  Therefor for my race-day warm-up I decided to bike the run route, and then did a quick solo jog to clear my head.  In-between my warmup and the starting horn I was able to talk to a few racers in the morning including Speed Sherpa teammates, fellow AG racers, and new tri-friends that I have gained throughout the season.

Race Breakdown

### Swim

I can't really expand on the pool as it matches [Salute][salute].  However, I am going to pat myself on the back as I made the wise decision to tell the 15y female swimmer that she should start in front of me.  She took off!  This meant I had nobody in front of me and I was faster than the person behind me... there was zero pressure from any other racer to mess with my head.  I couldn't ask for a better swim conditions, and my awesome (for me) average pace is the result.

### Bike

Since I was able to ride the route on Saturday, I knew: when turns were coming, when road obstacles were approaching, when the "hills" would start/end and the gears I wanted to use.  I didn't have any cars in my way this morning unlike [Salute][salute], and was picking off riders one by one.  I felt free, alive, and was flying.

### Run

Last week I received a bike challenge from [Coach Josh][ss], but this week was a run challenge!  Hit the 5k w/ a sub 7:00m pace!  I knew this was going to be hard, again I was familiar with the route, plus I used it for my warm-up earlier.  I wasn't sure if I were going to achieve that challenge, but when I crossed the finish line I was happy knowing that pushed myself.

Post Race Thoughts

So there it is... the end of the 2017 Sprint season for me, which means I don't know if this site is going to be updated very much for the rest of this year.  I'm working on a longer race in October, but technically I haven't paid for the event so I need to get that *minor* detailed cleared.

<figure class="align-right"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/2017/07/16/Sizzling-LG-3.jpg"><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/2017/07/16/Sizzling-SM-3.jpg" alt="" /></a></figure>As for the race results, I was able to secure 2nd place again due to a ringer who "never raced a pool swim before".  Thanks buddy for "trying" it out today.  I still had a blast, and overall beat my time from a couple of months ago in EVERY SINGLE CATEGORY: Swim (7s), T1 (11s), Bike (29s), T2 (1s), Run (27s).  Not only did I improve overall, but I was also able to accomplish my Coach's challenge of hitting a 6:58s average pace on the run!

Really glad things worked out with adding [Williamsburg][williamsburg] at the last minute, and then raced again one week later.  I'm not sure if I'll do the whole Series again next year... but anytime that I'm looking for a fun local sprint, Rev3 is where I'll be looking first.
