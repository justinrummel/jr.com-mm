Yes a Race Report!  First one in almost two years as the last time I wrote anything was in 2019 for the <a href="{{ site.url }}/14-06-sprint-2019-race-report/">TIN 14.06 Sprint</a>!  I wish this race report was full of accolades and show how wonderful I did maintaining my health over such a long period of time, but my performance was the result of what my body can do at this time.  100%... I did the best that I could do on race day and it was terrible.

Life Background (where I fell apart)
---

February 2020 I was looking forward to a new race season, unsure of which I would participate in, but new I needed to start working in pushing those WATTS on the bike.  I was doing a on/off thresholds at FTP when my chain stuck to the rear hanger; which was then **SHOVED INTO MY CARBON FIBER FRAME**.  I can never ride my Tri bike outside again.  It is no longer safe with the carbon structure compromised... the day my baby died.

Then COVID.

Motivation was at an all time low as I couldn't swim because the pools were closed, couldn't race without having to purchase a new bike, and started working on the basement to get it finished (since I was living there all the time for work).  I was also having some health issues so I decided to get that taken care of at the begging of this year, which gave me more reason to not exercise.  I restarted workouts around mid-to-late April with all of my endurance lost, all my strength lost, and gained about 20 lbs.

Race Breakdown
---

Now you know WHY I did so terrible, lets talk about the actual race.  This is the first time I participated in an event at Luray, but I knew from other people that Luray's route was hilly.  This is a Duathlon which was setup for a 1.7 mi trail run, 41 km bike, then a 10 km run.

### Run 1

<figure class="align-left"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/2021/08/23/Luray-LG-5.jpg"><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/2021/08/23/Luray-SM-5.jpg" alt="" /></a></figure>The trail run was great!  It started with a quick climb on rock gravel then around the lake and into the trails.  The trails were very technical where at times I would nearly stop as the tree roots were also being eroded away and required a large step down.  We found ourselves going around the entire like and finally reconnected with the triathletes as they were exiting the swim.  A fun 5-star, fast, and technical trail route.  I was feeling really confident as I felt I was moving fast, but then again also worried about I may be going too fast with the hills on the bike and second run still ahead of me.

### Bike

<figure class="align-right"><a href="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/2021/08/23/Luray-LG-1.jpg"><img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/2021/08/23/Luray-SM-1.jpg" alt="" /></a></figure>Remember I no longer have a street safe triathlon bike (I still use it in the basement on the trainer for indoor workouts).  For the race I had to bring out my old Road bike which was recently upgraded from a 10-speed to an 11-speed w/ a large 32 tooth gear in the back for climbing.  I thought my ideal race pace would be to hold 175 W throughout the bike course which would be 85% of my FTP.  Unfortunately I have NOT done a single ride grater than one hour and I was about to complete a 40 km ride which I thought would take about 90 minutes.

My estimate was close, I was actually 180 W for the entire ride and it took me 1:34:31... however I fell apart pushing that ride.  Both legs began to cramp.  My arch in my left foot cramped (no idea why) which required me to unclip and shake out.  For the last climb I had to drop to that 32 tooth cassette but it was terrible as I was going so slow I thought I would tip over, but I couldn't stand up and try to climb my way up the hill as my leg cramps wouldn't allow the balance.

I was a mess, the bike segment killed me.

### Run 2

I quickly realized I wasn't going to catch up to get third place... so I resorted to "Walk UP; Run DOWN" run plan.  The hills were long and moral was low.  I knew I wasn't going to give up as I'm only going 10km... but my body can't keep up with what my mind thinks is possible.  The rolling hills just punished me, one after the other.

Post Race Thoughts
---

The race was not a friendly race for someone restarting their exercise routines.  In my head I know what I am capable of and this is NOT representative of something to be proud of.  However, it is officially the first race of 2021... no idea if there will be another this year... but I do enjoy the adventure so I look forward to the next event!
